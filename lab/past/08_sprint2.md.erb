title: Sprint 2

* <%= team_deliverable "Prepare a demo of what you have working so far." %>
* BEFORE LAB, write a post with team status.. At least one sentence per member with what they completed this week, what they plan to complete in the coming week, and if there are any obstacles.
* <%= team_deliverable "Weekly status update post." %>

#### Project Work
* Note about handing in deliverables:
	* On time - Yes, the day of class by class time. Not a suggestion. If you need an extension please say so.
	* Complete - I take time to write it precisely, please try to follow along
	* Ready to be reviewed - Yes we actually read and try it all. Sometimes would like to see more pride in the quality of work delivered.

* All teams use the full two hours (minus 30 minutes) to code on their projects.
* Pito and Amin are available for consultation. Bring questions or areas where you want to consult.

##### Demos
* Each team takes 5 minutes to summarize progress to date, what the plan is for the coming week, and demonstrate their product so far.
