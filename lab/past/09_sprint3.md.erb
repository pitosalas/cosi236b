<%= homework_hdr %>
* <%= team_deliverable "Prepare a demo of what you have working so far." %>
* BEFORE LAB, write a post with team status:
  * Three sections: Accomplishments Last Week, Commitments for Coming Week, Obstacles
  * Each section, one or two sentences for each team member
  * Posted to Piazza: One Post.
* <%= team_deliverable "Weekly status update post." %>

#### Project Work
* Note about handing in deliverables:
  * On time - Yes, the day of class by class time. Not a suggestion. If you need an extension please say so.
  * Complete - I take time to write it precisely, please try to follow along
  * Ready to be reviewed - Yes we actually read and try it all. Sometimes would like to see more pride in the quality of work delivered.

* All teams use the full two hours (minus 30 minutes) to code on their projects.
* Pito and Amin are available for consultation. Bring questions or areas where you want to consult.

##### Demos
* Each team takes 5 minutes to summarize progress to date, what the plan is for the coming week, and demonstrate their product so far.
