<%= homework_hdr %>
* BEFORE LAB, write a post with team status:
  * Three sections: Accomplishments Last Week, Commitments for Coming Week, Obstacles
  * Each section, one or two sentences for each team member
  * Posted to Piazza: One Post.
* <%= team_deliverable "Prepare a Demo of your best stuff. Post weekly status update post." %>

#### Demos First!!
* Each team takes 5 minutes to summarize progress to date, what the plan is for the coming week, and demonstrate their product so far. 

#### Project Work
* All teams use remaining two hours (minus 30 minutes) to code on their projects.
* Pito and Amin are available for consultation. Bring questions or areas where you want to consult.
