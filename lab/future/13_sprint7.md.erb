title: Sprint 7 -- Preparation for Showcase
css_class: bold
---
I hope you all had a good vacation, and that you've been making great progress on your products! I couldn't update the web site tonight so instead I will put important info in this note, the plan for this Thursday, April 24.
 
Don't be scared by how much text is on this page. I am trying to be as detailed and specific as possible. I will answer all your questions about this and refine/revise this on the web site as we get closer to the Showcase. I will also be scheduling 1-1 meetings for each team later this week or early next week to help you get this as good as you can. I want everyone to achieve success! 

##### Logistics of Product Showcase
* Date: Tuesday May 6th, from 9:30 to 12:30.
* There will be 6 Product Reviewers
* Each team will have 15 minutes, 10 for presentation, 5 for questions

#### The work due for Thursday's lab is:
* Prepare for Showcase which is a week from Tuesday: May 6 at 10:00am
* This is our equivalent of a final exam. Refer to the Grading info on the web site to see the impact.
* There are three deliverables: a demo, a presentation, and a handout
* I expect that all of these will be in a 50-60% done state by Thursday
* See below for tips on each of these deliverables
* Everyone watch this video that gives fantastic tips on giving a good presentation: [This Week In Startups - Sharktank](http://thisweekinstartups.com/shark-tank-takeover-427/)
* Each team will do their demos+presentation and we will look at your handouts
 
#### During class, each team will be asked to come to the front and:
* Do their demo as it stands (5 minutes)
* Talk through their presentation as it stands (5 minutes)
* Show their handouts on the screen (no need to print)

The rest of the time will be used to continue to prepare and code on projects
Pito and Amin are available for consultation. Bring questions or areas where you want to consult
 
#### Details on final deliverables for the course
Here are the details of what the deliverables should contain (by the showcase)

##### General:
* This is not a marketing or selling course.
* In each of the deliverables, make sure there's a dose of technical info about:
	* The architecture
	* The key technologies used
	* The interesting technical parts of the product
 
##### Demo
* This is part of the presentation, after one or at most 2 slides
* Take around 5-7 minutes to demo your product. By now, you should be able to demonstrate your product!
* Yes there may be bugs and uglyness which you will have a week to fix
* You do need to work on a demo 'script'
* The best demo scripts tell a bit of a story where you try to 'hook' the listener with a scenario that they recognize
 
##### Presentation
* Should be Powerpoint, Google Presentation or whatever you prefer
* All members of the team will be part of the presentation. Not all students need to talk equal amounts.
* You should practice it at least once
* Demo is part of the presentation, but very close to the start
* Cover what the product does, what's interesting technically, what technologies used, for who does it solve what problem, and any preliminary idea on how it would make money.
 
##### Handout
* You will also need a 2-sided 1-2 page, color, "flyer" describing your product and project.
* The look and feel should be something like this [JBS Flyer](http://www.brandeis.edu/jbs/upcomingprograms/cosivoice/cosivoiceflyer.pdf)
* Each project will need to print 30 copies of their handout
* It's ok if there is a lot of text, but do include at least one screenshot and also a diagram of the architecture
* Include names and emails of the team members
