* <%= team_deliverable "First weekly status update post." %>

#### Project Work
* All teams use the full two hours (minus 20 minutes) to code on their projects.
* Pito and Amin are available for consultation
#### Demos
* Each team takes 5 minutes to summarize progress to date, what the plan is for the coming week, and demonstrate their product so far.
