title: Vagrant Setup

[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) is a software that acts as a wrapper around [virtualization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization) software like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [VMWare](http://www.vmware.com/), and provides a more convenient approach to setup reproducible and portable work environments and an efficient and flexible workflow. It can easily be integrated with [provisioning tools](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/) like Chef and Puppet, and there are many useful plugins that can be installed to add optional features. <br/><br/>  


####How to setup Vagrant

Before installing Vagrant you should have one provider installed. For this course we recommend you to use [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). After VirtualBox is installed, download [the provided Vagrant box](http://goo.gl/hd8uHK) and follow the steps below:

1. Download Vagrant from [here](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
2. Install it and make sure that you can run `vagrant` from your terminal (on windows run it in command prompt, and on OS X run it in Terminal app)
3. Create a new directory anywhere you prefer. This directory will contain Vagrant config file and all your projects' files)
4. Open your terminal
5. Go to the directory you created in step 3 by running `cd <path to your directory>`
6. Run `vagrant box add <box name> <path to the .box file>` (e.g. `vagrant box add ubuntu13.10 ubuntu-13.10-i386.box`)
7. Run `vagrant init <box name>`. Note: `<box name>` should be the same as the one you entered in step 6. (e.g. `vagrant init ubuntu13.10`)
8. Run `vagrant up`

If the last command works fine, you can connect to your box by running `vagrant ssh`.
