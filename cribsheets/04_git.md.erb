###What is Git?

Git is a [version control system](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) that keeps track of changes to files, so that you can have a history of all the changes made to a file and you can revert to a specific version later on. Here are some features of Git:

* Keep separate branches of development
* Rollback to a previous version if a bug was found
* Different versions for development and deployment; the deployment version should be a stable one
* Merging branches into one branch
* ...

###What is Github?

Github is a web application that provides hosted version control services using Git. You can sign up and create public repositories for free, but you should pay to create private repositories. There are other similiar services among which are [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org) and [Gitent](https://gitent-scm.com).
