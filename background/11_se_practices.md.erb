1. Source Code Management: Each student has a private Github repository and each team has a team Github repository. All coding assignments are submitted through Github.

1. Every application or homework should be submitted with Github.

1. Each separate "program" or "assignment" or "project" is stored in a **separate** directory, and a **separate** github repository.

##### Ruby Programming

1. Set tab to 4 spaces

1. Put your name at the top of every source file
<%= ruby_begin %>
# author: Pito Salas
<%= ruby_end %>

1. Use no $global variables

1. No methods longer than 12 lines

1. No classes longer than 100 lines of code

1. No more than four parameters in a method

1. No top level methods (i.e. methods not part of a class)

1. Capitalize, camel case Class names, e.g. CylinderBlock

1. Variables are all lowercase, with _ to break words, "Snake Case", e.g. initial_speed

1. Contants are all UPPERCASE
