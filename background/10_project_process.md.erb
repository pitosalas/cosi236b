##### Products

* For this class we focus on database backed web appications
* Implemented with Ruby and RoR (+ other technologies)

##### Teams

* We will form teams of 4 students (no less no more!)
* Think **roughly** about roles:
	* Models/Databases/Authentication/Authorization/
	* User interface/HTML/CSS/JS/UX/Mpbile
	* Interactions/Controllers
	* Web Services/Deployment/System integration/Testing
