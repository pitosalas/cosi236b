* Read [Rails Guide on Form Helpers](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html) with a metaphorical pen and paper in hand. Take notes, especially about points you did not understand or could not get to work. <%= deliverable "Piazza post with your notes." %>
* Create a very simple Rails application which shows off a handmade (not scaffolded) form. Refer to <%= link_to_topic :hw_railsform %>. <%= deliverable "push the app to github, supply the github url and a very short screencast demoing the operation of the form, in a piazza post." %>

  * HTML (HAML, Markdown)
  * JSON (YAML)
  * CSS (SASS, SCSS, LESS)

  * Syntax checking and syntax errors
  * Versions (HTML5, )
  * Given to 'interpreter' or 'compiler' to do something
