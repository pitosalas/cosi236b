title: Authentication Continued, Project Plan
---
<%= homework_hdr %>
* For each product, implement (or adapt) a User model: registration, login and logout. I recommend (strongly) that you follow the pattern that is laid out in [Ruby on Rails Tutorail](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/modeling-users#book_menu) - Chapters 6,7 and 8. <%= team_deliverable "Implement simple authentication for your product. Update your project's git repo with the new code." %>

#### Project Planning
* Laying out a plan to achieve success
* Drop dead date: April 11, week before Spring Recess
* After that there are 1.5 weeks left before Product Showcase

#### Caution
* Divide and conquer!
* Dig into the difficult things - don't avoid them in favor of the easy things!

#### Narrow your focus!
* Remember the feedback form your PRs! Take it to heart
* Make a detailed mockup/paper prototype of your 1 or at most 2 core views!
* Everything from here on should be support that core view and nothing more!

#### Chunks of work
1. Identify what gems you need and learn them
1. Database up and running (focus on core views)
1. User accounts: registration, login, logout, administration
