title: Authentication Continued, Project Plan
---
<%= homework_hdr %>
* Each product team: design the absolute minimum demo of your product that you want to ahve working by the product showcase. What is the essential coolness of your product? Can you demo that? Remember a perfect login or user settings page is not essential coolness. Think of the aha reaction you want in the viewer. <%= team_deliverable "A detailed paper prototype of the minimum coolness demo (mcd) of your product. Detailed not because it has beautiful colors but because it covers the layout AND interactions that will work." %>

#### Project Planning
* Laying out a plan to achieve success
* Drop dead date: April 11, week before Spring Recess
* After that there are 1.5 weeks left before Product Showcase

#### Caution
* Divide and conquer!
* Dig into the difficult things - don't avoid them in favor of the easy things!

#### Narrow your focus!
* Remember the feedback form your PRs! Take it to heart
* Make a detailed mockup/paper prototype of your 1 or at most 2 core views!
* Everything from here on should be support that core view and nothing more!
