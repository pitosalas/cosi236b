* Read:
  * [RESTful Web Services](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-restful/)
  * [Chapter 5 of Roy Fielding's Dissertation](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1)
* <%= deliverable "Write a blog post contianing your reflection on this" %>
  * Roy Fielding's dissertation has been quite influential in the way systems are built. The term REST has really caught on but more than that, he identified an architectural pattern and was able to articulate where it fits into a broad architectural scheme.
  * Reflect on how academic research and dissertations like this one can affect, and be affected by, the engineering work done at places like Google and Apple. Think for example about the HTTP verbs and explain how Fielding uses them to expand on the conventional model of web interaction with static pages (GET) and/or forms (POST)
