<%= homework_hdr %>
* Each product team: design the absolute minimum demo of your product that you want to ahve working by the product showcase. What is the essential coolness of your product? Can you demo that? Remember a perfect login or user settings page is not essential coolness. Think of the aha reaction you want in the viewer. Let's call that the MVP - Mininum Viable Product <%= team_deliverable "A detailed paper prototype of the MVP of your product. Detailed not because it has beautiful colors but because it covers the layout AND interactions that will work." %>

#### Project Planning
* Laying out a plan to achieve success
* Drop dead date: April 24, week before Product Showcases!
* Getting from here to there!

### Narrow your focus!
* Remember the feedback form your PRs! Take it to heart
* Make a detailed mockup/paper prototype of your 1 or at most 2 core views!
* Everything from here on should be support that core view and nothing more!
* Divide and conquer! Make sure each team member has a distinct deliverable!
* Dig into the difficult things - don't avoid them in favor of the easy things!

##### Sprints
* Every lab will be the end of a sprint. 
* We have 6 sprints left (about half the semester.)
* The last one will end April 24 by which time the MVP is completed.
* Work back and forward from there to figure out what happens during each of the sprints

##### Chunks of work
1. Identify what gems you need and learn them
1. Database up and running (focus on core views)
1. User accounts: registration, login, logout, administration
1. Work out your URL scheme and build the routes
1. Build up some interesting demonstration data to show off your product.
1. Write tests
1. Use ActiveAdmin to quickly get an admnin UI to all your data
1. Bootstrap for your UI framework (recommended)
1. Implement Key Views for app
1. Background processing if needed
1. Google Maps if needed
1. Deployment to Heroku
1. Implement continuous integration and/or deployment
1. Anything else...?

##### Show-n-tell
* Each team uses the screen to show off their MVP paper prototype
* In the remaining time, teams meet to work out what's in each sprint
