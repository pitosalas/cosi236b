#### Introduction
* As an app runs, need to know "who is loggred in"
* Remember the case of "no one is logged in"
* User is designated internally by a User (or Account, or similar concept)

#### Mechanics
* Authentication support has to:
	* Present a log in page
	* Present a account creation page
	* Check the "credentials"
	* Make the identity of the logged in user 'globally available' within your app
	* What is the 'identify of the logged in user?', it's just a method called 'logged_in_user' that when called returns an instance of the User model.
* But should not:
	* Decide what operations that user may do or not. Conceptually and architecturally, should be kept separately
	* Store the user's password in a database. How do you authenticate then?

#### Implementation and Tools
* There are several popular gems to implement authentication
* Beware that the fact that there is a gem does not mean that it's trivial
* You need to understand what's going on.
* Advice: Avoid getting fancy with OAuth, or FB or LinkedIn log in.
* Start with a simple password
