<%= homework_hdr %>
* Download this [WebService Demo](https://github.com/pitosalas/webservicedemo) to your computer
* Download and install a REST Client app. For example [rest-client](https://code.google.com/p/rest-client/) or [Chrome Advanced Rest Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/)
* Familiarize yourself with one or two real Web Services (also called Web APIs or APIs). Here are some interesting starting points:
	* Everything known about wine: [Wine.com API](https://api.wine.com)
	* Open Government Data: [Sunlight Foundation API](http://sunlightfoundation.com/api/)
	* APIs of cooking recipes: [Yummly](https://developer.yummly.com)
	* [Reddit API](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API)
	* [US Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/developers/)
	* [Weather Information](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/)
	* A huge directory of all kinds of web services: [Programmable Web](http://www.programmableweb.com)
* Most web services (APIs) need an API-key of some kind (free). Get one
* Experiment with the REST client and one of the Web services described above
* Using the REST client app above: try some calls and get them to work
