* Download this [WebService Demo](https://github.com/pitosalas/webservicedemo) to your computer
* Download and install a REST Client app. I suggest Advanced REST Client for Chrome
* Let's think about wine!
	* Look at the API for wine.com (https://api.wine.com)
	* Get yourself an API key for that api
	* Look through the API documentation for the Wine.com API
* Let's think about the government
	* Look at the API fr the Sunlight FOundaton (http://sunlightfoundation.com/api/)
	* Get yourself an API key for that one
	* Look through the documentation
* Be creative and describe a cool program you could write using one or both of these apis.
	* A simple idea: A list of all Wines that have a name with more than n words.
	* Another one: A list of wines with the word Kosher in the name
	* Another one: Look up a wine, find out where it is made, and display today's high and low termperature in that area
	* Ok so those ideas are all kind of dumb...
