* Deploy your product to Heroku. You will have to review the [Heroku](heroku.com) web site to find instructions on how to get a product to be deployed onto Heroku. Some of you have already done it, that's great. For the others it might be a good idea to get one of your team members to work out how to do it while the other (1,2 or 3) continue working on the product.
* Add a CodeClimate Badge to your Readme page in Github. Easy.
* Enable your product for continuous deployment on Codeship.io. I suggest your putting one of your team members alone on readingup on Codeship and getting it to work while the others keep working on the product.
