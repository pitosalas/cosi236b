title: The Web, URLs and Routing
type: page

##### Homework due for today

* How does a browser process a URL? When I type http://www.salas.com:8080/toplevel?p=1 what happens inside the browser, what actions does it take, what messages does it send out, what messages does it receive? 
  <%= deliverable "Research this on the web or in books and come up with a numbered list of actions, with each step in the list being a link to a source on the web that you used to figure that out." %>

##### Discussion
* Go around room, and each student says the next step in the process

##### The World Wide Web

* 3 critical protocols or formats
  * HTTP - Hyptertext Transfer ProtocolP
  * URI - Universal Resource Identifier
  * HTML - Hypertext Markup Language

* Actually there are a bunch more that are almost as important
  * CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
  * JS (or ECMA) - Javascript
  * More?

* All this is based on foundational Internet protocols
  * TCP/IP
  * DNS

* Dissecting the URL
  * Protocol
  * Host Name (see also: domain name, subdomain name)
  * Port (default for http is 80)
  * Path 
  * Parameters

* HTTP Protocol
  * Client makes a request (a packet is sent)
  * Server Responds to the request (a packet is sent back)
  * URL is on the "envelope" of the request
  * Stateless

* HTTP Requests contain:
  * Request "method"
  * URL
    * Host name
    * Path
    * Parameters
  * Request Headers

* HTTP Responses contain
  * Status code
  * Response headers:
    * Content-type
    * Content-length
    * Lots of other stuff
  
##### Understanding this is critical!

###### Use Telnet to experiment with TCP/IP
  * TCP/IP sends and receives 'text' protocols
  * The command line indicates the target host and port
  * Then you can type in the message

> 
    telnet example.com 80
    GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.example.com

###### Use an app to visualize HTTP
  * Mac only: [Rested](http://www.helloresolven.com/portfolio/rested/)
  * Other platforms: [rest-client](https://code.google.com/p/rest-client/)
  * Mac version of [rest-client](https://github.com/mmattozzi/cocoa-rest-client)

##### Review: What does TCP/IP do?
  * Sends a 'message' from one computer to another (often message is text)
  * Destination computer is designated by a host or domain name
  * Destination within the computer is designated by a port number
  * The format or Interpretation of the 'message' is determined by the port
  * Usually port 80 messages are interpretted as HTTP

##### Review: What does HTTP do?
  * Expects a "request" message which is answered by a "response"
  * Request message
    * Defines a "method"
    * Defines the "path"
    * Supplies information about the format and lots of other stuff
  * Response message
    * Defines a status code
    * Defines format of the response
    * Defines the response body
