#### Homework for today
* Read [Sandy Metz's Rules](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers). Be ready to explain them in class.
* Read Chapter 4 (Introduction to Ruby) in AWDR. It will be a good review of what you've worked on so far. I am sure you will find some new insights and goodies there. Try out code examples from the book. 


##### Programming Assignments
* Discuss PA1
* Introduce PA2

##### Ruby Highlights

* Key things to show about Ruby
* Basic OO design
* OO Lingo
	* Objects
	* Classes
	* Methods
	* Instances
	* Duck Typing

* Sandy Metz's rules

* Look at [Sandy Metz's Rules](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers)
	* Classes can be no longer than one hundred lines of code.
	* Methods can be no longer than five lines of code.
	* Pass no more than four parameters into a method. Hash options are parameters.
	* For Rails: Controllers can instantiate only one object. Therefore, views can only know about one instance variable and views should only send messages to that object (@object.collaborator.value is not allowed).
