##### Putting together teams

To help in organizing the teams, I am asking everyone to *really quickly* Fill in [Skills Inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Avr8qvL1EWecdENZQkpxQ2V2dEVjbjNaS3NzRjZ0UGc#gid=0). (This page is protected until the day of class) Obviously this is not graded. The purpose is to help us put together good teams. **Do it now please**

* How will the projects work? <%= link_to_background :project_process %>


##### Working in teams

* Working in teams can suddenly become CHALLENGING
* You are not trying to become best friends, you are trying to get something done
* A significant part of your grade will depend on how well your team functions
* Each member of the team is responsible for their own work and for the welbeing of the team
* Triangle Exercise
* Discussion about teams

#### Ruby Live Coding Demonstration and discussion
