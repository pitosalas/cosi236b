##### Homework Due For Today

##### Putting together teams
* To help in organizing the teams, I am asking everyone to *really quickly* Fill in [Skills Inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Avr8qvL1EWecdENZQkpxQ2V2dEVjbjNaS3NzRjZ0UGc#gid=0). Obviously this is not graded. The purpose is to help us put together good teams. **Do it now please**
* Working in teams can suddenly become CHALLENGING
* You are not trying to become best friends, you are trying to get something done
* A significant part of your grade will depend on how well your team functions
* Each member of the team is responsible for their own work and for the welbeing of the team
* Triangle Exercise
