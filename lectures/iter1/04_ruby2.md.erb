#### Homework due for today

* Read Chapter 4 (Introduction to Ruby) in AWDR. It will be a good review of what you've worked on so far. I am sure you will find some new insights and goodies there. Try out code examples from the book. 
* Research what Ruby Gems are. Experiment with some code. Research Bundler (a ruby utilty.) Experiment with Bundler. <%= deliverable "Write a blog post explaining what you learned." %>
* <%= deliverable "Check in your PA2 so far into Github" %>
* <%= team_deliverable "Write your project kickoff post in Piazza" %>
	* Each team get meets to jointly write their team kickoff piazza post
		* Confirm team members
		* Name of product
		* what role (team and technical) each person seems to fall into
		* What interests the team most about this product

#### Mention
* Elevator pitches on Monday
* Live coding seminar today at 3pm in Volen 118
* Office hours:
	* Pito: Thursday 10:00am-11:30 in my office
	* Amin: Tue and Friday 10:00-11:00 in TBD

#### Object Oriented Design
* classes: How do you decide what a class is and what it is not?
* classes and objects
* instance variables
* constructor (no destructor
* methods: private/public
* inheritence: rarely is this the best solution
* composition and delegation: a better solution
* Polymorphism
* "Duck" typing.
	* Do you see how duck typing is an alternative/complement to inheritence?
	* Consider a method like #can_speak? in a gaming application

#### Ruby Gems
* Package Management
* Ruby Gems
* Ruby Bundler
 
#### Ruby Live Coding Demonstration and discussion
