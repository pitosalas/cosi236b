#### Homework due for today

<%= bold_red "Note for first day of class:" %> Each day of class has a page on this web site. The first section of that page is always the homework due on that very day. So in other words, the homework listed here is actually "pre-work" for day one. We will go over this in a little more detail during class.

1.  Why are you taking this class? Why are you getting a COSI degree? What do you see yourself doing after graduating? What are the top three things that you hope for this class?

	* *Please give this a little thought. It will become important when I challenge you to come up with a product or service idea. It will also be important to me to understand how to @lead the class.* <%= deliverable "No more than 1 page, as a post to piazza" %>
1. Study the requirements for the programming assignments: <%= link_to_pa :intro_pa %>. Also read closely the assignment for <%= link_to_pa :PA1 %>. Come ready to discuss the approach you will take in class.

##### Introductions
 
* Introduce Pito, where I came from, and why I am excitied about this course. Look at <%= link_to_background :pitofaq %>
* Go around and introduce yourself: name, year, why you are here. Point to next person.
* Mugshots are collected!

##### What is this course about: Software Engineering

* What is Software Engineering anyway? 
* <%= discussion "How is it diffent (or is it different) from Computer Science?" %>
* <%= link_to_background :learning_objectives %>

##### Exercise
* Pair up with person next to you
* Look through the whole course web site and discuss it with your partner
* Each pair asks a question about the curriculum or anything else.

#### Putting together teams

To help in organizing the teams, I am asking everyone to *really quickly* Fill in [Skills Inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Avr8qvL1EWecdENZQkpxQ2V2dEVjbjNaS3NzRjZ0UGc#gid=0). (This page is protected until the day of class) Obviously this is not graded. The purpose is to help us put together good teams. **Do it now please**

##### Programming Assignments
* Answer questions about programming assignments - see <%= link_to_pa :intro_pa %>
* Review exactly what <%= link_to_pa :PA1 %> is about. Answer questions.

##### Next class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_lecture :ruby %>
