##### Homework due for today

<%= bold_red "Note for first day of class:" %> Each day of class has a page on this web site. The first section of that page is always the homework due on that very day. So in other words, the homework listed here is actually "pre-work" for day one. We will go over this in a little more detail during class.

1.  Why are you taking this class? Why are you getting a COSI degree? What do you see yourself doing after graduating? What are the top three things that you hope for this class?

	* *Please give this a little thought. It will become important when I challenge you to come up with a product or service idea. It will also be important to me to understand how to lead the class. Submit this as a  post on Piazza.*
	* <%= deliverable "No more than 1 page, as an email to pitosalas@gmail.com" %>
