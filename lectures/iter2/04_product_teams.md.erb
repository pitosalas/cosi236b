#### Product work
* Standups
	* One member from each team stands up, and takes 5 minutes to state the status of their project
	* Topics to cover:
		* What we accomplished so far
		* What we plan to accomplish next week
		* Anything blocking our progress?
* Split into teams and continue working on your products
