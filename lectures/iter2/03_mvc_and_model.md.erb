#### Review of MVC

* Reminder: 
	* Basic Client <-> Server structure
	* MVC is a general pattern
	* Here we are applying it to a web (http) **server**
* The Models: contains the application 'state'
	* Think of it as what you want preserved if your app (i.e. the server in our case) has to be restarted
	* Think of your user's reasonable expectations
	* Discussion
* The Controllers: master control switch
	* Sees requests from the outside world
	* Asks the models for data, sometimes updates the data
	* Asks the views for new pages or results
	* Responds to the request
	* (Note: this parallels the HTTP protocol exactly!)
* The Views
	* Use data (given by the controller)
	* To create and assemble responses to be sent
	* Responses are html, but may be other formats too

#### Fundamental importance of the URL
* In particular the 'path' part of the URL
* e.g. 
	* http://roomscheduler.com/room/3/request
	* http://bookstore.com/book/412/price
	* http://tourmanager.com/city/boston/tour/tuesday/new
* There are many ways to structure a url
* This 'style' is sometimes called RESTful
