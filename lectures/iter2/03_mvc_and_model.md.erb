* Read ADWR Chapter 7, Validation and Unit Testing. <%= nb "Try hard to understand what is going on. You need this." %> Make a recording of you running the rails server and showing that the various pages work (not of your whole coding session.) Notice that you will have to have the previous chapters work working as well. If you are having trouble, please let Amin and/or Pito know and we will get you unstuck. <%= deliverable "A link to your screen recording." %>
