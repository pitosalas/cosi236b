#### REST, Resources and Controllers
* We've had some discussions about designing URLs
* We talked about using a "directory structure-like" syntax for your URLs.

#### Job of the controller
* Recall, the URL is parsed by the router, which locates and calls the right controller
* Breaking it down:
    1. Router parses URL
    1. Determines the controller (error: Can't find Controller's ruby file in app/controllers/)
    1. Determines the action insider the controller (error: Can't find a method for the action
    1. Calls the action method, with the parameters corresponding to the 'rest' of the url
    1. When action completes, a view of the same name is located (error: Can't find Views html.erb file in the views/<controllername>/ directory)
    1. View's 'erb' is expanded and returned, through controller, router, web server, back to the user.

#### Resources in Rails
* Automatic wiring of plumbing between urls, routing, models, and controllers
* Takes advantage of standardized patterns
    * CRUD operations as actions
    * Nesting model in the URLs
    * Controller naming
* Huge time saver and bug saver!
