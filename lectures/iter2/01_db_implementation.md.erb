<%= homework_hdr %>
* Read Chapters 5 and 6 of AWDR. It is important that you really try and execute all the code snippets there and get them to work. Notice that "rails new depot" creates a directory called "depot" from whereever you are. So cd to your /mydev and to rails new depot from there. Follow along and do all the code in Chaoter 6, prove to yourself that it runs. <%= deliverable "Screencast of you demonstrating what you got to work from those two chapters." %>
* Work on Programming Assignment 3 (See <%= link_to_pa :PA3 %>)
