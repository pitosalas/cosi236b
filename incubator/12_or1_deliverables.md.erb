#### Running the meeting
* Look at this as a "product review meeting" you might have with the CEO or CTO of your company. See also [BillG Review](http://wmworia.wordpress.com/2007/10/22/bill-g-review/)
* The meeting will go around 1 hour. Make the most of it.
* The team should lead the discussion to decide what to cover next.
* It's kind of like when you go to the doctor, they ask you, "So what brings you here." You decide how to use the time.
