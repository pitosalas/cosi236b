title: Student Deliverables for PR Meeting 1
---
#### Logistics
* Meeting will be on Thursday, Feb 26, during our normal lab time
* See: <%= link_to_incubator :product_reviewer_logistics %>

#### Product Dossier
* The product dossier is a single, top level Google Drive Folder, with individual items for the following. Some items will be google docs, others will be links to github, other might be other kinds of documents.
* The section below gives a list of all the bits of content that are required. Depending on the team, you may have other things that you consider important. Feel free to add them.
* By the time the first meeting with your Product Reviewer, the dossier needs to be neat and understandable. Consider it a presentation package.
* You likely will have a separate "work area" for your team for rough notes or other interim documents.

#### Running the meeting
* Look at this as a "product review meeting" you might have with the CEO or CTO of your company. See also [BillG Review](http://wmworia.wordpress.com/2007/10/22/bill-g-review/)
* The meeting will go around 1 hour. Make the most of it.
* The team should lead the discussion to decide what to cover next.
* It's kind of like when you go to the doctor, they ask you, "So what brings you here." You decide how to use the time.
