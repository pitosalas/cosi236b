As you know, a central part of this course and lab is the development of a product, working in a team with 3 other students. Each team will get to pick from a list of well defined products. Some come from the previous class, Cosi 235a, some come from me, and some may come from incoming students.

You will have a chance, during the first week of class, to submit a product proposal. There are very specific guidelines and not all submissions are automatically accepted. The submissions will be evaluated along these lines:

1. How clearly defined and understood is the product?
1. How feasible is it to be developed during one semester?
1. How committed is the proposer to the product?

If your product is accepted and added to the "official list" then you will try and form a team around that product. The proposer has to be a member of the team, and might easily emerge as the leader of that team, although that's not required nor assumed.

In order to propose a product you need to submit an Incubator Product Proposal.
