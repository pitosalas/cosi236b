As you know, a central part of this course and lab is the development of a product, working in a team with 3 other students. Each team will get to pick from a list of well defined products. Some come from the previous class, Cosi 235a, some come from me, and some may come from incoming students.

You will have a chance, during the first week of class, to submit a product proposal. There are very specific guidelines and not all submissions are automatically accepted. The submissions will be evaluated along these lines:

1. How clearly defined and understood is the product?
1. How feasible is it to be developed during one semester?
1. How committed is the proposer to the product?

If your product is accepted and added to the "official list" then you will try and form a team around that product. The proposer has to be a member of the team, and might easily emerge as the leader of that team, although that's not required nor assumed.

In order to propose a product you need to submit an Incubator Product Proposal.

#### Incubator Product Proposal

* **Proposer:** [your name]

* **Product and Team name:** [This can be anything you want. Sometimes people just pick a code name like Team Alpha, and sometimes a descriptive name like Team Affective Tutor. You can always change it later.]

* **Tweet length summary of project:** [140 characters]

* **Team Members:** [up to 3 other people. Proposer has to be part of the team]

* **Product Summary:** (1-3 paragraphs)

* **Elevator pitch:** [Elevator Pitch as you might use for a non-technical business savvy person, for example a senior member of Brandeis administration 

* **Describe the customer(s):** [a few sentences]

* **Describe what "jobs" the product will do for the customer:** [a few sentenecs]

* **Customer Pains/Gains:** [describe what problems the product will solve for the customer]

* **Money**: [how might this product become self-sustaining or even profitable?]

* **Personal statement:** [why I think this is a product that should be built, and why I want to build it]

* **Design**: One or two "paper prototypes" to illustrate your current vision of the product. It is really not necessary to make them super pretty, the intent is to show what, for example, the home page or some other critical page would look like, roughly. Focus more on the commands or menus or links, and terminology. And consider whether someone looking at that screen would have a sense of what the product is doing and what the user is supposed to do. A neat hand drawing is fine. Scan or photograph it and include a Jpeg.

* **Basic Database Schema:** Think about the "things" (entities) that the product's database will need to keep track of. Entities are often nouns, like User, Event, Pet, Manufacturer, Animal Shelter, and so on. Think also about the relationships between them, one to one, one to many, and so on. For example, User to Pet is one to many, Pet to Breed is Many to One, and so on. Describe your database schema at a high level, for example:

        Entity: Pet
            Name
            Owner
            Breed
        Entity: Animal Shelter
            Name
            Pets
            Address
            Phone Number
        Relationships
            Animal Shelter to Pet is One to Many
