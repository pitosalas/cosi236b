title: Mentoring Plan
---
Each product team in the incubator will have a mentor. I will be recruiting a mentor for each of the five teams.

#### Role of the mentor
The teams should be getting the concepts and nuts and bolts of building the product from the class and from their own work. The Mentor's role is to periodically check in with the team and give them an outside sounding board on the project in areas such as:

* Priority setting on features to do and not do
* Suggesting technologies, platforms, etc to look into
* Pointing out similar products that could serve as models
* Team dynamics and assignments

#### Interactions
The mentor is welcome to structure his or her involvement in whatever way that is agreeable. This is a model for how it might work.

* **Team Prep**: (Iter 1: Late Jan/Early Feb) Team prepares a Google Drive "Dossier" about their product. The Dossier will be maintained over the duration of the project.
* **Face to Face Meeting** (Iter 2: Early Feb) Team + mentor have a face to face kick-off meeting, at the mentors convenience. The objective of the meeting will be to have everyone meet each other, and to set a baseline. The meeting will have a specific agenda. 
* **Phone or Skype meeting** (Iter 3: Early Mar) The team prepares a status update email, and any updates to the dossier. This update is the basis for a skype update meeting.
* **Phone or Skype meeting**: (Iter 4: Early April) The team prepares a status update email, and any updates to the dossier. This update is the basis for a skype update meeting.
* **Final Presenetation:** (Iter 5: Very early in May) Final presentation day. By now the products should be in a demoable state. Each student team will have 15 minutes to present their product to an invited audience. The mentor is invited to be an outside expert to help judge the results.

##### Student and teacher responsibility
* Prepare a framework of questions and issues to discuss with the mentor before each meeting
* Design an appropriate agenda for the meeting, built around the convenience of the mentor
* Making sure the mentor has update materials several days before the call
