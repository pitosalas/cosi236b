* **Proposer**: William Tarimo

* **Product name**: The Affective Tutor-Assistant

* **Tweet length summary of project:** An in-class web and mobile application providing an efficient standard platform for students and instructors to actively engage and interact about class materials.

* **Team Members:** William Tarimo, ...

* **Product Summary:** This product is envisioned to help teachers and their students engage in more effective pedagogy, partly by helping them manage students' emotions and levels of understanding. This vision has shown the potential to enhance classroom teaching and learning, especially for large classes.  
	
	We envision to make it a complete classroom application package provides an efficient and effective standard platform for students and instructor to engage and interact about class materials. Students can easily give real-time emotional and cognitive feedback, help each other sustain engagement in active learning through back-channel supportive conversations, and functionality for instructors to efficiently assess students' issues and understanding by using the iResponder functionality (questions, quizzes and collaborative group tasks). iResponder is a very light weight but powerful class survey tool, compare it to iClicker or Learning Catalytics? This feature allows the professor to easily (and on the fly) give questions, quizzes and collaborative group tasks to the class and then see the answers as they come in.  It also allows a TA (or instructor) to intelligently grade the answers in real-time as they come in or being discussed in class

* **Elevator pitch:** The Affective Tutor-Assistant is a complete classroom application that offers effective and efficient means to interact, collaborate and exchange feedback in classrooms.

* **Personal statement:** This product and insight are inspired by (or results of) my doctoral research in intelligent educational technologies, and therefore there is a reasonable potential in being a successful new vision and product. I have also built a functional prototype that has been used in a few classes with positive feedback and results.

* **Describe the customer(s):** Schools, school administrators, instructors and students.

* **Describe what "jobs" the product will do for the customer:** 
	* Will offer a single application that will make classroom engagement and interaction more effective and efficient towards learning and teaching goals.
	* Will train students and instructors to be more intelligent emotionally and cognitively by making them aware of their states and how to manage them in ways that are positive and motivational towards learning. 
	* Will offer and effective and accurate way for students to give emotional and cognitive feedback with respect to learning. Presented effectively, this feedback will help instructors be more accurately informed about the students and the teaching methodologies, providing the change of effective adjustments and guidance.
	* Will offer efficient functionality for instructors to test and assess students’ understanding and issues through questions, quizzes and collaborative tasks done in real-time, at any time during class, and outside class time.
	* Will offer students a way to sustain engagement in learning by having students collaborate and help each other overcome moments of confusion and boredom during class. Fellow students, TAs and instructors will collaboratively engage and answer questions about the on-going class materials.
	* Will offer tools for instructors to collect and manage students’ class participation and attendance.
	* Will offer a repository for students’ information, grades, and class participation as well as attendance. 

* **Money**: There is the obvious potential to make revenue through product usage, from purchases and subscriptions from teachers and schools.

* **Customer Pains/Gains:** 
	* There is no single product that addresses common classroom problems, especially targeted towards improving the core of learning and teaching in the importance of positive emotion and motivation. For those who bother, then they are forced to use more than one application, like Piazza, clickers, and class websites.
	* Current classroom ways to interact and collaborate are inefficient and ineffective, they also do not allow equal participation from all students as they are prone to personal discomfort as well as language and cultural difficulties when interacting in class.
	* Instructors don’t have practical means to get and use feedback, comments and questions from students.
	* Instructors don’t have rich and seamless tools to test and assess students’ understanding and problems.
