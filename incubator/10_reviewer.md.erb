title: Product Reviewer
---
Each product team in the incubator will have an outside "Product Reviewer."" 

#### Logistical details and schedule
* Can be found here: <%= link_to_incubator :product_reviewer_logistics %>

#### Role of the reviewer
The teams should be getting the concepts and nuts and bolts of building the product from the class and from their own work. The reviewer's role is simply to get an update at the end of each iteration and give the team their feedback from a practical, outside world perspective. 

* Priority setting on features to do and not do
* Suggesting technologies, platforms, etc to look into
* Pointing out similar products that could serve as models
* Ideas on issues that team might be hitting.

#### Time Commitment
I estimate that you (the reviewer) will need to spend about 4 hours total over the next 2.5 months. Here are the approximate guidelines.

The team will is repsonsible for preparing all the materials and running the meeting. They are in the process of putting together a "Dossier" (see <%= link_to_incubator :or1_deliverables %>) which will be ready for you a few days before the first meeting.

* Product Review: Feb 27, Thursday, 2:00pm to 4:00pm at Brandeis (committed)
* Product Review: April 3. Thursday, 2:00pm to 4:00pm at Brandeis (tentative)
* Final Showcase: May 1, Thursday, 2:00pm to 4:00pm at Brandeis (tentative)

The Product Review meetings will be the Product Reviewer plus the four team members. It is meant as a working session where the PR reacts, comments and critiques the project status. (Think about the famous [billg reviews](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/06/16.html))

The Final Showcase has each of the teams doing a 12 minute presentation plus demo in front of all the PRs. They all get a chance to react to what they see and give an overall assessment. The Brandeis community will be invited but in practice we will probably have no more than 15 people in the audience.

##### Student and teacher responsibility
* Prepare a framework of questions and issues to discuss with the reviewer before each meeting
* Design an appropriate agenda for the meeting, built around the convenience of the reviewer
* Making sure the reviewer has update materials several days before the call
