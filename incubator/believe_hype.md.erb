### Believe the Hype

##### Incubator Product Option

* **Proposer**: Joe Botsch

* **Product Name**: Believe the Hype

* **Team Members**: TBD

**Tweet Length Summary**: App that allows for fans to rate local fighters through fighter profiles and for bookers to search for who the fan believes are the most exciting fighters.

**Product Summary**: Why is it so difficult to be discovered by a larger promotion? All through high school, my favorite sport was wrestling. I was engrossed with the grit and toughness of the sport and as a result several friends steered me toward mixed martial arts which had only just began to get popular. At the time it was on very late at night on Spike tv so the viewership was very small. This year it is being featured during primetime on Fox Sports. After competing myself at the amateur level and building websites for friends' merchandise that they wear in the cage, I wondered why wasn't there an app that made finding opponents and promoters easier. The struggle to fill a fight card and find a suitable opponent is very real and there are thousands of exciting young athletes searching for a way to become noticed.

It's next to impossible for a big promotion to take a look at my highlights and for people to see when my next fight is or to view my merchandise. The biggest officials in the sport believe that they want athletes who deliver exciting bouts as opposed to a fighter with an immaculate record who has been spoonfed easy opponents. The fans offer the easiest way to sift through the best candidates to put on a card. However, they dont want to fill out questionaires they would rather swipe and quickly rate their hometown heroes which is something that one could easily integrate into app. Also the ability to see a fighter's most recent bouts, is a game changer because it allows an athlete to grow their fanbase from the palm of their hand.

**Elevator Pitch**: This app is a way for fighters to let their fans rate how exciting they are. Fighters will be given a profile and some type of meter that gauges how good or bad they are based on fan ratings. Promoters will be able to sift through these fighters and find the highest rated profiles to fill their next card.

**Customers**: Our customers are any fighters looking to make a name for themseleves. We would also be gearing ourselves toward fans who want to rate athletes who they find exciting. The final customers are the promoters

**Describe what “jobs” the product will do for the customer**: The customers will be able to either promote themselves or rate who they find exciting.

**Customer Pains/Gains**: 
1. Fighters have a hard time finding a promoter to book them and opponents to fight.
2. We believe that pro organizations and local promoters are always looking for new fighters to add to a card. 
3. We believe that there is no place for people who like MMA to discuss amaeteur and semi-pro fighters.

**Money**: Charge advertisers of popular fight apparels or any new group looking to market their brand for add space. Also charge the promoters/bookers to look at each profile that the fans have rated. Fighters can request opponents and managers can help market their athletes and search for sponsors all in one convenient location.

**Personal Statement**: I am one of the most active people in underground mma forums and I have been a fighter myself. I have the insider knowledge and domain expertise to make this product a success. Technically it would be difficult to build as it would require mainly database manipulation. I feel like this is something many athletes would use on a daily basis and similar products have worked for high school athletes leading me to believe me and a team could have similar success here.
