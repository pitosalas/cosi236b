* **Proposer**: Sharat Sridhar

* **Product**:  What’s Going On

* **Team Name**: Undergrad Underdogs

* **Team Members**: TBD

* **Product Summary/Elevator Pitch**: There are times when people want something to do but can’t find an activity.  If they check the internet they will find a lot of suggestions for events at certain times but never anything going on in the moment.  Social media sites provide information on people’s activities and events, but typically either in the past or planned for the future.  As a result, for people who want something to do spontaneously there is no way to know what friends are up to unless they ask them directly.  But the friends who are engaged in fun activities are typically too busy to report on them, even if they would like others to stop by and join the activity.

	What’s Going On solves this problem.  What’s Going On uses Wi-Fi locating to broadcast the locations of the users without the users having to even open the app.  This information is placed on a map so that a user can look and see where all his/her friends are located.  The users can even provide info about what they are doing in a location which will be visible to all their friends as long as the user is in the location.  As a result, a collection of real-time information on the activities of a user’s friends are available to them so that they can easily find something fun to do at any given time.  As for any concerns about privacy, the app provides a variety of easily activated privacy options that limits how much the app broadcasts at any given time.  What’s Going On is a safe way for real-time information to be spread amongst friends so no one ever has to ask himself/herself “What’s Going On?”

* **Describe the customers**: Customers will be universities, beginning with Brandeis. 

* **Describe what “jobs” the product will do for the customer**: Provide real-time information to students about what is happening on campus as well as the ability to find friends nearby with building specificity. Provide university statistics on general activity of students.

* **Customer Pains/Gains**: Students are busy and don’t have time to see their friends on their schedule. This app lets the customer know who is nearby at any time without the need of texting each person individually. Too much information in emails from student events. This app provides tailored, relevant information to the customer. 

* **Money**: Ads, promotional space can be bought by different student groups, sell statistics to universities.

* **Personal Statement**: With classes, jobs, and clubs, I found it extremely difficult to meet up with my friends during the week. If I knew that a friend was getting lunch when I’m leaving class, I would go out of my way to see that person. However, this information is not available to us and I would not want to spend the time texting a bunch of friends and wait for their responses when I could be back in my room in that time. I know I am not the only one who faces this issue and I believe this app could solve this problem for me and many others.
