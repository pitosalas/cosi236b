##### Acknowledements

A lot of the content, topics, homeworks and other information in this course web site was originally developed as part of the 2010, 2011 and 2012 Computer Science JBS courses at Brandeis University. That course was designed taught by Professor Tim Hickey and Pito Salas and so Tim deserves a good deal of credit and thanks for the material herein.
